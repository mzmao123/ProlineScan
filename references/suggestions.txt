# suggestions
- variable name dict  (dsspList): dict is a reserved key word of python (so does list, tupple)
- form XXX import * : it is better to do the import explicitly
- function name prolineSuperimpose -> backboneSuperimpose is better fit its function

- proline conformations: we may need functions to save and load the conformations for later access
